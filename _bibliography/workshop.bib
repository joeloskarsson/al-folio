    abstract = {The rise of accurate machine learning methods for weather forecasting is creating radical new possibilities for modeling the atmosphere. In the time of climate change, having access to high-resolution forecasts from models like these is also becoming increasingly vital. While most existing Neural Weather Prediction (NeurWP) methods focus on global forecasting, an important question is how these techniques can be applied to limited area modeling. In this work we adapt the graph-based NeurWP approach to the limited area setting and propose a multi-scale hierarchical model extension. Our approach is validated by experiments with a local model for the Nordic region.},

    abstract = {We propose a temporal graph neural network model for graph-structured irregular time series. The model is designed to handle both irregular time steps and partial graph observations. This is achieved by introducing a time-continuous latent state in each node of the graph. The latent dynamics are defined using a state-dependent decay-mechanism. Observations in the graph neighborhood are taken into account by integrating graph neural network layers in both the state update and predictive model. Experiments on a traffic forecasting task validate the usefulness of both the graph structure and time-continuous dynamics in this setting.},
