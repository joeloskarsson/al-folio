    abstract = {We propose a temporal graph neural network model for graph-structured irregular time series. The model is designed to handle both irregular time steps and partial graph observations. This is achieved by introducing a time-continuous latent state in each node of the graph. The latent dynamics are defined using a state-dependent decay-mechanism. Observations in the graph neighborhood are taken into account by integrating graph neural network layers in both the state update and predictive model. Experiments on a traffic forecasting task validate the usefulness of both the graph structure and time-continuous dynamics in this setting.},
