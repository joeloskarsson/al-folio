This Tuesday I finally arrived to Zürich, Switzerland.
I'll be spending the next year here, studying the first year of my master at ETH Zürich.

I've spent the first couple of days getting some paperwork in order and exploring the city and campus.
Zürich is a very beautiful and interesting city.
Next week I'll be taking part in a project called [ETH Week](https://www.ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/sustainability/lehre/ETHweek.html).
It's cross-disciplinary one week project and this years theme is "Energy Matters".

Courses will then begin on the 17th September. I'll mostly be doing courses related to AI in different ways.
I feel very excited to be here and can't wait for things to really get started.
