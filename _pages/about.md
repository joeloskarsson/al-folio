I am a PhD-student at the Division of Statistics and Machine Learning, Department of Computer and Information Science, Linköping University, Sweden.
My main supervisor is [Fredrik Lindsten](https://lindsten.netlify.app/) and co-supervisors [Per Sidén](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=0UomzRIAAAAJ) and [Jose M. Peña](https://www.ida.liu.se/~jospe50/).
I am an affiliated PhD-student within the [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/) program.

In my research I aim to develop probabilistic machine learning methods for structured data.
I develop methods for data with spatial-, temporal- and graph-structure, including combinations of these.
 <!--In particular I am interested in how more traditional probabilistic methods in these domains can be combined with deep learning in order to derive new methods with useful properties.-->
I also enjoy applying these methods to weather and climate data.

I got my masters's degree in computer science and engineering from Linköping University in 2020.
In 2018-2019 I spent a year as an exchange student at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.
<!--I grew up in Lindesberg, Sweden and currently live in Linköping.
I am an avid Linux user and a believer in free and open source software. Openness of ideas, culture and research is very important to me. -->

My CV is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joeloskarsson/CV/academic/docs/CV.pdf).

### Current interests
These are some things that I am interested in and/or work on at the moment. I try to keep this somewhat up to date.

* Spatio-temporal data analysis
  * Machine learning for modeling weather and climate
  * Modeling continuous time signals using deep learning, Neural ODEs
* Machine learning on graphs
  * Bayesian modeling on graphs, Graph GPs, GMRFs
  * (Spatio-) Temporal graph neural networks
