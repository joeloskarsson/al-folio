I am a PhD-student at the Division of Statistics and Machine Learning, Department of Computer and Information Science, Linköping University, Sweden.
My main supervisor is [Fredrik Lindsten](https://lindsten.netlify.app/) and co-supervisors [Per Sidén](https://liu.se/en/employee/persi28) and [Jose M. Peña](https://www.ida.liu.se/~jospe50/).

In my research I aim to develop machine learning methods for data-analysis on structured data.
I develop methods for data with spatial-, temporal- and graph-structure, including combinations of these.
In particular I am interested in how more traditional probabilistic methods in these domains can be combined with deep learning in order to derive new methods with useful properties.

I got my masters's degree in computer science and engineering from Linköping University in 2020.
In 2018-2019 I spent a year as an exchange student at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.
I grew up in Lindesberg, Sweden and currently live in Linköping.
<!-- I am an avid Linux user and a believer in free and open source software. Openness of ideas, culture and research is very important to me. -->

### Current interests
These are some things that I am interested in and/or work on at the moment. I try to keep this somewhat up to date.

* Machine learning on graphs
  * Bayesian modeling on graphs, Graph GPs, GMRFs
  * (Spatio-) Temporal graph neural networks
* Spatio-temporal data analysis
  * Anything at the intersection of probabilistic methods and deep learning
  * Modeling continous time signals using deep learning, Neural ODEs
* Deep generative models
  * MMD-based models
