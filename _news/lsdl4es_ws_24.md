I presented [our work on probabilistic weather forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04759) at the ["Large-Scale Deep Learning for the Earth System"](https://cesoc.net/workshop-on-large-scale-deep-learning-for-the-earth-system/) workshop in Bonn. Slides are available [here](/assets/pdf/lsdl4es_24_slides.pdf).
