New preprint on ["Probabilistic Weather Forecasting with Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04759). Code is available on github, for [global forecasting](https://github.com/mllam/neural-lam/tree/prob_model_global) and [limited area modeling](https://github.com/mllam/neural-lam/tree/prob_model_lam).
