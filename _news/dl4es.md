I attended the very exciting workshop *Large-scale deep learning for the Earth system* ([webpage](http://graphics.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/workshop)) and presented some ongoing work in collaboration with the Swedish meteorological and hydrological institute. Slides are available [here](http://graphics.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/workshop/talks/Oskarsson_slides_dl4es_workshop_oskarsson.pdf).
