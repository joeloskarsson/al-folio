Together with great collaborators at the Division of Vehicular Systems I have two papers on trajectory prediction accepted for publication:
* ["MTP-GO: Graph-Based Probabilistic Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction with Neural ODEs"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00735) accepted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles
* ["Evaluation of Differentially Constrained Motion Models for Graph-Based Trajectory Prediction"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05116) accepted to IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV) 2023
