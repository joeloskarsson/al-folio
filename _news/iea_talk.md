I gave a talk about Neural LAM weather models at the webinar ["Deep Learning for Weather-Based Power Prediction"](https://iea-wind.org/2024/01/14/workshop-deep-learning-for-weather-based-power-prediction/), organized by [IEA Wind Task 51](http://iea-wind.org/task51/).
A recording is available [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6H7diavQdg) and my slides can be found [here](/assets/pdf/slides_neural_LAM_IEA_wind.pdf).
