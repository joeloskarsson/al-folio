I attended the ESA-ECMWF workshop ["Machine Learning for Earth System Observation and Prediction"](https://www.ml4esop.esa.int/) in Frascati, Italy.
Had the pleasure to present our work on probabilistic weather forecasting ([slides](https://az659834.vo.msecnd.net/eventsairwesteuprod/production-nikal-public/4565548b495e48eb9c0ffa8b91bea354)) and a community poster about [Neural-LAM](https://github.com/mllam/neural-lam).
